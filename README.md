## Simple ATM Simulation

This Python program simulates a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system with three types of bank accounts: Checking Account, Savings Account, and Business Account. Users can interact with the program by selecting their account type, checking their balance, and making withdrawals.

### Features:
- Three types of accounts: Checking, Savings, and Business.
- Each account stores personal information such as name, age, date of birth, and account number.
- Users can view their account summary, including personal information.
- Users can deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts.
- Account balances are maintained and updated based on deposits and withdrawals.
- Input validation ensures that users cannot withdraw more than their account balance.

### Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Insert your customer ID number (e.g., account number) to access your account.
3. Choose your account type (Checking, Savings, or Business) using the provided widgets.
4. Perform actions such as checking your balance or making withdrawals.

This program serves as a simple example of object-oriented programming in Python, demonstrating inheritance and encapsulation concepts. It also showcases the usage of IPython widgets for interactive user input.

Feel free to explore and modify this code for educational purposes or as a starting point for more advanced ATM simulation projects.
